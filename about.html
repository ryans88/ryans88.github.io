			<h1>About Us</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="abouttext about1">
			<p>Here at Thinking Tree we are dedicated to saving as many trees as possible. Trees bring life to the world and act as a home to those we share this planet with. Thinking Tree is comprised of several different world-renowned carpentry teams that are skilled in creating masterful works of art that are also functioning "houses". Check out our gallery to see some of our work, or enjoy the slider images at the top of the page.</p>

		<div class="abouttext about2">
			<p>Thinking Tree was originally comprised of one group of skilled carpenters that wanted to make a difference in the world, one tree at a time. Through the donation system countless acres of flora and fauna have been protected to ensure the survival of not only our primary source of oxygen, but also the homes of thousands of different species of animals and insects. Thinking Tree takes the donations they receive from all over the world to purchase large plots of forest, and in these forests great treehouses are built. These treehouses are then sold to philantrophists looking to purchase a luxurious and eco-friendly vacation spot. All proceeds from Thinking Tree projects are then recycled back into the preservation of forests around the world. Thinking Tree is a non-profit organization, and will remain so until the donations run dry.  </p>
